# 👋 Hi there! I'm Bhavya Karri 👩‍⚕️💻

I am a passionate aspiring gynecologist, blending my love for women's health with innovative technology through AI tools. I’m currently developing a mini project (Telegram bot) focused on women’s wellness, along with a website that's still a work in progress.

## 🔬🌐 Current Projects
- **Well women zone bot**: A bot that provides information on hormones and their effects based on age, common women's symptoms, and tips for managing them. It also shares mood-boosting quotes and a consolidated list of helpful resources for both mental and physical health. This is a simple Python program generated by AI, not a technical project—just a small step toward supporting women's health.
